Low-Level Design (LLD) of the Discussion Platform
Overview
The discussion platform consists of the following major components:
1.	User Management
2.	Discussion Posts
3.	Comments
4.	Likes
5.	Authentication & Authorization
Each component will have its own API endpoints, database schema, and interactions with other components.
User Management
•	Endpoints:
o	POST /register: Register a new user.
o	POST /login: Authenticate a user.
o	GET /users/{id}: Get user details.
o	PUT /users/{id}: Update user details.
•	Data Base Schema
 CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
Discussion Posts
•	Endpoints:
o	POST /posts: Create a new post.
o	GET /posts: Get a list of all posts.
o	GET /posts/{id}: Get details of a specific post.
o	PUT /posts/{id}: Update a post.
o	DELETE /posts/{id}: Delete a post.
Data Base Schema 

CREATE TABLE posts (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  user_id INTEGER,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id)
);

Comments
•	Endpoints:
o	POST /posts/{id}/comments: Add a comment to a post.
o	GET /posts/{id}/comments: Get all comments for a post.
o	PUT /comments/{id}: Update a comment.
o	DELETE /comments/{id}: Delete a comment.
DataBase Schema

CREATE TABLE comments (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  post_id INTEGER,
  user_id INTEGER,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (post_id) REFERENCES posts (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id)
);

Likes
•	Endpoints:
o	POST /posts/{id}/likes: Like a post.
o	DELETE /posts/{id}/likes: Unlike a post.
DataBase Schema

CREATE TABLE likes (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  post_id INTEGER,
  user_id INTEGER,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (post_id) REFERENCES posts (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id)
);

Authentication & Authorization
•	JWT Tokens: For secure authentication.
•	Middleware to protect routes.
Microservice Architecture
Breaking the system into microservices involves creating separate services for each major component. Each service will be responsible for its own database and functionality.
Services
1.	User Service
o	Manages user registration, authentication, and user details.
o	Database: users
o	Endpoints: /register, /login, /users/{id}
2.	Post Service
o	Manages creation, retrieval, update, and deletion of posts.
o	Database: posts
o	Endpoints: /posts, /posts/{id}
3.	Comment Service
o	Manages comments on posts.
o	Database: comments
o	Endpoints: /posts/{id}/comments, /comments/{id}
4.	Like Service
o	Manages likes on posts.
o	Database: likes
o	Endpoints: /posts/{id}/likes
Communication
•	API Gateway: Routes requests to the appropriate microservice.
•	Service-to-Service Communication: Using REST or gRPC.
•	Database per Service: Each service manages its own database.

| Database: users |             |                     |
+-----------------+             +---------------------+
                                    |
            +-----------------------+------------------------+

+-----------+---------+                          +-----------+---------+
| Comment Service     |                          | Like Service        |
+---------------------+                          +---------------------+
| Endpoints:          |                          | Endpoints:          |
| /posts/{id}/comments|                          | /posts/{id}/likes   |
| /comments/{id}      |                          | Database: likes     |
| Database: comments  |                          |                     |
		


Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, improving the modularity and maintainability of the system.
This LLD and microservice architecture should give you a solid foundation for building your discussion platform. Let me know if you need further details or assistance!
